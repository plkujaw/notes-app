As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```

```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```

```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```


(NB: notes do not need to be permanently stored.  If the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes, and that's fine.)
